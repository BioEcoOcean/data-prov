  "description": "<p>The workshop &ldquo;Data Product Development for Modelling Benthic Carbon Processes in the Arctic&rdquo; was held online on 8th and 10th October 2025. It was organised by the EU-funded BioEcoOcean project in collaboration with EU funded projects POMP, SEA-Quester and NECCTON. The workshop gathered experts in Arctic marine biogeochemistry, benthic ecology, and modeling to identify gaps and develop a roadmap for generating benthic carbon data products suitable for model applications. The event consisted of two 3-hour online sessions combining plenary discussions and collaborative group work using Miro boards. In total 30 participants from 15 countries and 20 institutions attended.</p>",
