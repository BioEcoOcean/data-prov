  "description": "<p><strong>The shallow coastal environments around Gotland: a vital link between nature and </strong><strong>people</strong><br>The island of Gotland lies in the heart of the Baltic Sea, surrounded by shallow coastal waters<br>that are both ecologically rich and deeply connected to local culture and livelihoods. These<br>nearshore environments, with their exposed rocky areas, as well as calm, sheltered bays,<br>underwater meadows, and sandy seafloors, are essential to a wide range of plants, animals,<br>and human activities. For centuries, these ecosystems have provided food, recreation, and<br>natural beauty, and they continue to do so today.</p>",
