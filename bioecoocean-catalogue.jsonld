It is grounded incomprehensive overview of the BioEco ocean observing landscape and informed by several co-creative workshops, where experts critically examined and contributed to the Blueprint components and their interconnections.

      "description": "<p>This report provides an integrated overview of traditional and emerging methods for monitoring marine biodiversity, with emphasis on Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs). Traditional visual sampling methods such as underwater visual census (UVC), quadrat surveys, and net tows have long formed the backbone of biodiversity monitoring, offering high taxonomic resolution and compatibility with historical data.</p>\n<p>Emerging technologies&mdash;including environmental DNA (eDNA), imaging&nbsp;combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis, and remote sensing (satellites and drones)&mdash;promise to boost biodiversity observations by increasing spatial and temporal coverage, automating labor-intensive processes, and reducing environmental impact. eDNA enables non-invasive detection of cryptic species, while AI image analysis automates species identification and habitat quantification. Remote platforms such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) extend survey capabilities into deep or otherwise inaccessible environments.</p>\n<p>Key findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each method. eDNA excels in sensitivity but faces challenges in assigning species to sampling sites and in abundance estimation. AI imaging supports scalable monitoring, but requires large, annotated training sets. Acoustic methods offer large-scale tracking of biomass via proxies, but they still lack taxonomic precision. Hybrid approaches are emerging as best practice: combining traditional methods with novel tools is necessary for cross-validation and to maximize spatial and temporal coverage. Calibration remains essential, as it requires reference libraries and standardized protocols. The combination of traditional and emerging biodiversity observing technologies aligns with ethical research principles, such as the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement), especially by reducing the impact associated with destructive sampling.</p>\n<p>We recommend adopting integrated monitoring frameworks that combine in situ, genetic, and remote sensing data collection, tailored to the goals and constraints of each project. Supporting policy development and training efforts will be key to mainstreaming these approaches across the EU and global marine monitoring networks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The creation of this new template considered the following:</p>\n<p>1) The audiences it aims to inform, including decision-makers and policymakers, funders, ocean observers, technologists, and data managers.<br>2) The needs of the different expert panels, i.e. physics, biogeochemistry (BGC) and biology and ecosystems panels, who will be using this standardised template<br>3) Simplification of the terminology used to make the information more accessible<br>4) The addition of a thorough metadata and data management section that provides the necessary information to contribute data to global ocean observing.</p>\n<p>From the restructuring of the EOV specification sheet template, an interactive guide (this deliverable) was created. The guide allows users to understand the information within the EOV specification sheets.

      "description": "<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>Human society relies on, and interacts with, a diverse assortment of organisms and ecological systems, from the local to the global level. Research and management of these coupled social-ecological systems requires data that speaks to the variety of processes, statuses, and situations defined by them. Effective stewardship is enhanced by interdisciplinary thinking and, critically, access to interoperable data describing human society and governance and ecological and environmental conditions. Such approaches are inherently challenging, especially for those without broad training. In this paper, we propose a workflow harnessing the Social-Ecological System Framework to identify, access, and utilize geospatial data from across a spectrum of social and ecological indicators. We demonstrate the application of this workflow using Tropical Indo-Pacific seagrasses as an example system and in doing so, demonstrate the wealth of available open-data which can support an enhanced understanding of social-ecological system dynamics. With this workflow, we provide a readily applicable tool for use by coastal researchers and managers to support more inclusive social-ecological decision making.</p>",

      "description": "<p>ABSTRACT: Are you working to understand and protect marine life? Do you think that fragmented data, disconnected initiatives, and communication barriers hold us back? This workshop offers a chance to be part of changing this narrative. Led by the BioEcoOcean project, this interactive session invites you to take an active role in co-creating the Blueprint for Integrated Ocean Science - a pioneering global support tool designed to transform how we observe, understand, and manage marine ecosystems. The Blueprint is not a framework imposed from elsewhere. It is being built collaboratively, and this workshop is a key moment to ensure that the priorities, challenges, and ambitions of early career researchers are also firmly embedded in its design. Through structured discussions, participants will shape a practical tool encouraging communication that strengthens biological and ecosystem observations, connects fragmented efforts, and guides future partnerships, funding strategies, and management actions. The Blueprint will directly support regional and global marine conservation goals, ecosystem-based management, and policy implementation, aligned with frameworks such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sustainable Development Goals. The insights generated here will feed directly into the Blueprint, which will launch in 2027 as an open-access, interactive platform endorsed by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) under IOC-UNESCO. This is your opportunity to ensure that the voice of early career researchers helps lead and define the future of integrated ocean observation. Join us - and be part of building a tool that serves both the region and the world.</p>",

They also support economies and inspire biotechnological innovations. This article aims to raise awareness of the value of plankton to humanity and serves as an informative guide for aquatic professionals, policymakers, and anyone interested in plankton. We present the value of plankton across six themes of human interest: biogeochemistry; ecology; climate; the evolution of science; economy; and culture, recreation, and well-being. Guided by the 2022 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services values assessment, we introduce the six themes under the Life Framework of Values to offer a comprehensive summary of the significance of plankton to humanity. In addition, we provide examples of plankton variables used in policy frameworks and recommendations for enhancing understanding of their value through long-term sustainable research and monitoring.</p>",

      "description": "<p>To effectively address the challenges of biodiversity loss and the compounded impacts of various anthropogenic stressors, including climate change and ecosystem disturbances, a coordinated and systematic approach to ocean observation and policy alignment is essential. The current fragmented landscape of observation efforts hinders collective progress in advancing scientific understanding and responding to critical ecosystem tipping points.</p>\n<p>To bridge these gaps, we are co-designing a comprehensive strategy that integrates policy recommendations with the development of standardized guidelines and regulations aimed at harmonizing and strengthening global and regional observation networks. This strategy focuses on enhancing evidence-based decision-making by fostering the co-creation and demonstration of operational, interconnected workflows. These workflows will cover the entire spectrum from observation system assessment and design to policy application, ensuring that collected data is robust, accessible, and directly applicable to management and governance frameworks in alignment with FAIR data principles.</p>\n<p>Central to this vision is the co-creation of a comprehensive, fit-for-purpose, and inclusive Blueprint for Integrated Ocean Science (BIOS). This blueprint promotes a holistic approach and encourages effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders and sectors, enabling interoperability across systems. The production of white papers and policy recommendations will bolster European leadership in the ocean-climate-biodiversity nexus.</p>\n<p>The EU-funded Co-Creating Transformative Pathways to Biological and Ecosystem Ocean Observations (BioEcoOcean) project leverage collaborative networks to promote best practices aligned with EU directives, such as the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), focusing on enhanced ocean observation, data curation, and standardization. A Community of Practice Forum (CoPF) will coordinate multi-disciplinary ocean observing efforts, engaging researchers, NGOs, industries and authorities. This co-creative approach bridges scientific research with practical application, fostering evidence-based policymaking and sustainable solutions. By integrating regional knowledge and promoting cross-sectoral partnerships, it enhances ecosystem services, socio-economic resilience, and long-term human well-being through impactful, science-based policies and sustainable environmental stewardship.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>How to cite:</strong> Karaca Hal&eacute;n, D., Palacz, A., Soares, J., Krzymiński, D., Lepola, N., and Mtwana Nordlund, L.: Blueprint for Integrated Ocean Science (BIOS): Advancing Harmonized Observation Systems and Policy Coordination for Sustainable Ecosystem Management, One Ocean Science Congress 2025, Nice, France, 3&ndash;6 Jun 2025, OOS2025-1320, https://doi.org/10.5194/oos2025-1320, 2025.</p>\n</div>",

      "description": "<p>In this study, we investigate the diversity and spatiotemporal distribution of gelatinous zooplankton (GZ) in the central Baltic Sea (coastal waters of Gotland and adjacent Eastern and Western Gotland Basins), a region characterised by low salinity and ecological sensitivity. Despite the Baltic Sea being the largest brackish water body globally, knowledge about its GZ, specifically, medusae and ctenophores, is limited. Our research synthesises the existing literature, open-access data, and local reports. Three to five GZ species occur within the studied area, with the common jellyfish Aurelia aurita dominating. Peak sightings of A. aurita happen between July and October, whereas the ctenophore Mertensia ovum and scyphozoan Cyanea capillata display sporadic occurrences. We identify notable gaps in understanding GZ phenology and food web impacts due to historical neglect and insufficient monitoring, particularly under low-salinity conditions (between 5 and 8), which restricts species richness. Jellyfish and ctenophores fall under the Essential Ocean Variable (EOV) &ldquo;Zooplankton Biomass and Diversity&rdquo; governed by the Global Ocean Observing System, UNESCO-IOC. EOVs are an approach for globally usable data and adhere to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. Including EOVs in routine collection and reporting would significantly enhance regional and global understanding, contributing to a holistic ecosystem view. Thus, we advocate for global ocean observation frameworks to comprehensively monitor GZ populations and their ecological, biogeochemical, and socioeconomic roles. Our findings serve as a crucial step towards understanding the implications of climate change for GZ assemblages in the Baltic Sea, promoting a holistic approach to marine ecosystem management.</p>\n<p>Associated data has been shared through OBIS: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.25607/skulof\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://doi.org/10.25607/skulof</a></p>",

      "description": "<p>Phytoplankton are responsible for releasing half of the world&rsquo;s oxygen and for removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from surface waters. Despite many studies on the topic conducted in the past decades, we are still far from a good understanding of ongoing rapid changes in the Arctic Ocean and how they will affect phytoplankton and the whole ecosystem. An example is the difference in net primary production modelling estimates, which differ twice globally and fifty times when only the Arctic region is considered. Here, we aim to improve the quality of Greenland Sea primary production estimates, by testing different versions of primary production model against&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>&nbsp;data and then calculating regional estimates and trends for 1998-2022 for those performing best. As a baseline, we chose the commonly used global primary production model and tested it with different combinations of empirical relationships and input data. Local empirical relationships were taken from measurements by the literature and derived from the unpublished data of Institute of Oceanology of Polish Academy of Sciences across the Fram Strait. For validation, we took historical net primary production&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>C data from literature and added to it our own gross primary production O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;measurements. Field data showed good agreement between primary production measured with&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>C and O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;evolution methods. From all the model setups, those including local chlorophyll&nbsp;<em>a</em>&nbsp;profile and local absorption spectrum best reproduced&nbsp;<em>in situ</em> data. Our modelled regional annual primary production estimates are equal to 346 TgC/year for the Nordic Seas region and 342 TgC/year for the Greenland Sea sector of the Arctic defined as 45&deg;W-15&deg;E, 66&deg;33&prime;N-90&deg;N. These values are higher than those previously reported. Monthly values show a seasonal cycle with less monthly variability than previously reported. No significant increase or decrease in primary production was observed when studying regionally averaged trends. The accuracy of the selected here model setups to reproduce the field data in terms of Root Mean Square Difference is better than in the related Arctic studies. The improved primary production estimates strengthen researchers&rsquo; ability to assess carbon flux and understand biogeochemical processes in the Greenland Sea.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Our understanding of gelatinous macro-zooplankton (jellyfish and comb jellies; GZ), in the Baltic Sea is limited. While GZ organisms can be a nuisance, they play essential roles in regional food webs and biogeochemical cycles. These organisms are known to tolerate increasing temperature and dropping oxygen concentration better than other invertebrates and fish. There is much speculation about recent increases in seasonal bloom extent and frequency. However, the lack of long-term data and consistent sampling protocols makes projections and distribution models unreliable. Research has focussed mainly on western Baltic native species, leaving central and eastern regions and additional species understudied. Recently introduced species like <em>Blackfordia</em>, <em>Maeotias</em>, and <em>Craspedacusta</em> have highlighted the need for further research. Furthermore, new approaches are required to enable marine ecologists, stakeholders, and policymakers to acquire data. Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs), identified by the Global Ocean Observing System (IOC-UNESCO), are key for globally coordinated marine data. GZ fall under the zooplankton EOV and the recommended variables to be measured are overall biomass, biomass or abundance (or presence/absence) by taxon, functional group or size class and should follow the data standards. By following FAIR data standards (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), GZ monitoring could significantly enhance global understanding. It is recommended that these variables are incorporated in existing/planned observations and/or monitoring of GZ along with locally/regionally relevant variables. The coordinated observations along with innovative ideas and combinations of approaches (e.g., large-scale polls, fishers, ferries), social media data mining, and sampling for environmental DNA may provide new platforms for studying spatial and temporal distributions of GZ in the central and eastern Baltic Sea.</p>",

In the face of climate change and biodiversity loss, it is essential to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms governing this cycle and its role in maintaining marine ecosystem health. Thus, harmonizing and standardizing international efforts in this area is indispensable. Under the aegis of the \"BioEcoOcean &ndash; Co-creating Transformative Pathways to Biological and Ecosystem Ocean Observations\" project, a focal living lab of Marine Organic Carbon Atlas (MOCA) has been established. The aim of MOCA is to develop strategies for collecting and integrating extensive data and metadata on organic carbon cycle observations into standardized formats, ensuring broad applicability for various stakeholder groups.</p>\n<p>One of MOCA's milestones is the development of a strategy to better incorporate seafloor observations, including the role of benthic organisms, into carbon cycle modeling. The benthos plays a fundamental role in the marine organic carbon cycle by processing organic matter, bioturbating sediment, sequestering carbon, and transferring it to higher trophic levels. However, the complexity of the benthic role in the carbon cycle significantly complicates the selection of suitable parameters for modeling, underscoring the ongoing need for consultation across scientific communities.</p>\n<p>Creating a cohesive strategy that includes the selection of parameters, standardization of data collection methods, promotion of data sharing, and implementation of these actions will enable a more comprehensive representation of benthic roles in carbon cycle modeling. This will contribute to more accurate predictions and a deeper understanding of marine ecosystem functioning.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Obieg węgla organicznego jest jednym z najważniejszych proces&oacute;w biogeochemicznych podtrzymujących funkcjonowanie ekosystem&oacute;w na ziemi. W obliczu zmian klimatycznych i utraty bior&oacute;żnorodności konieczne jest głębsze zrozumienie mechanizm&oacute;w go regulujących oraz jego roli w utrzymaniu zdrowia ekosystem&oacute;w morskich.

Pod egidą projektu &bdquo;BioEcoOcean &ndash; Wsp&oacute;łtworzenie strategii na rzecz zintegrowanych obserwacji oceanicznych&rdquo; powołane zostało żywe laboratorium - Morski Atlas Węgla Organicznego (z ang. <strong>MOCA </strong>&ndash; Marine Organic Carbon Atlas). <span>&nbsp;</span>Celem MOCA jest stworzenie strategii na zebranie jak największej ilości danych i metadanych o obserwacjach oceanicznych, dotyczących obiegu węgla organicznego, oraz ich integracji do standardowych format&oacute;w z myślą o ich jak najszerszym zastosowaniu przez r&oacute;żne grupy interesariuszy. Dodatkowo, zaprezentowany zostanie pilotażowy zestaw danych na przykładzie Oceanu Arktycznego. Rezultatem MOCA będzie zwiększenie naszej zdolności do regularnego i sp&oacute;jnego mapowania zasob&oacute;w i obiegu węgla pod kątem proces&oacute;w biologicznych (organicznych), a w efekcie do oceny zmian zachodzących w ekosystemach morskich.</p>\n<p>Jednym z kamieni milowych MOCA jest opracowanie strategii na lepsze uwzględnienie obserwacji dna morskiego, w tym roli organizm&oacute;w bentosowych, w modelowaniu obiegu węgla. Bentos odgrywa fundamentalną rolę w obiegu węgla organicznego w ekosystemach morskich poprzez przetwarzanie materii organicznej i bioturbację osadu, a także sekwestrację węgla i jego transfer do wyższych poziom&oacute;w troficznych. Niemniej jednak, złożoność roli bentosu w obiegu węgla znacznie utrudnia wyb&oacute;r odpowiednich parametr&oacute;w pomocnych w jego modelowaniu co podkreśla wciąż istniejącą potrzebę konsultacji r&oacute;żnych środowisk naukowych.</p>\n<p>Stworzenie sp&oacute;jnej strategii, obejmującej wyb&oacute;r parametr&oacute;w, standaryzację metod zbierania danych i promowanie ich udostępniania oraz implementacja tych działań pozwoli na pełniejsze uwzględnienie roli bentosu w modelowaniu obiegu węgla.

      "description": "<p>Marine conservation efforts targeting metazoans, including plankton, are crucial for maintaining marine ecosystem functions and services, such as ocean carbon sequestration. Vertical migration and trophic interactions involving metazoans significantly contribute to ocean carbon sequestration, with mesopelagic fishes and zooplankton playing key roles. Proposed expansions in fishing, targeting both mesopelagic fishes and krill, raise concerns about ecosystem impacts. However, gaps in data persist regarding how changes in metazoan abundance and biodiversity will affect carbon sequestration. To address this, we present the concept and early implementation steps of a Marine Organic Carbon Atlas which aims to synthesize data and develop ecosystem models for selected Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) like phyto- and zooplankton, and fish abundance and diversity. Incorporating habitat-forming variables like seagrass and macroalgae highlights their role in carbon sequestration. The atlas pilot demonstration, tested against modeling and science advisory needs, in particular those of integrated ecosystem assessments, aims to inform science-based conservation decisions, such as regulating emerging fishing of krill and mesopelagic fish to ensure ecosystem health and sustainable harvesting levels.</p>",

In this poster presented at the 2024 UN Ocean Decade Conference in Barcelona, we introduce the concept of the Blueprint for Integrated Ocean Science which is being developed under the EU BioEcoOcean Project. The Blueprint is being designed as a support tool (guiding document) which will pose complex, \"catch-all\" questions, encouraging collaboration and holistic thinking across diverse environments and sectors. We invite participants from around the world who are interested in contributing to the co-creation of the Blueprint, and who are involved in any part of the ocean observing value chain: whether you are reviewing ocean data, planning observations, collecting, managing and reporting data, or developing data synthesis and modeling products, or work with policy or management.</p>",
